    # Data loader from bytes received from MQ socket.
    # loader is used as follows to generate a dict representation of received bytes:
    #
    #     recv_method = getattr(sock, <recv.method>)  # `sock` is the MQ socket.
    #     loader = mq2db.JSONLoader(*args, **kwargs)  # Depending on the setting below.

    #
    # Default loaders are:
    # - mq2db.DictLoader
    #   Builtin loader for Python dict object.
    #   If no loader is specified, this is used by default.
    # - mq2db.JSONLoader
    #   Builtin loader for JSON.
    # - mq2db.TextLoader
    #   Builtin loader for UTF-8 encoded text.
    # - mq2db.CSVLoader
    #   Builtin loader for CSV (comma-separated values).
    # - your_package.your_module.YourLoader
    #   Custom loader can be used if it can be resolved via ordinary import system.
    #   In this case, a class named `YourLoader` under a module `your_module`,
